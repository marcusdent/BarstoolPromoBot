# barstool_promo_bot
A Twitter bot that responds to users' request for promo codes of advertisers on the Barstool Sports network. 

This is my first ever development project. I am going to attempt to build a Twitter Bot that responds specifically to users who "@" the @Barstool_Promo page asking for promo codes for specific advertisers. Obstacles will include making sure the users get the exact data they are looking for, making sure the bot doesn't respond to tweets it shouldn't, and keeping the promo code data up to date.
